# IMPORTANT UPDATE
as of today (2020-12-24), MineTime creator decided to go commercial (see [this issue](https://github.com/marcoancona/MineTime/issues/254#issue-760438812))

this github repository of mine remains here as historical reference

# minetime-kbd-shortcuts

## Scope

Based on my usage of the MineTime software ([home page](https://minetime.ai), [GitHub page of the MineTime project](https://github.com/marcoancona/MineTime)), I decided to collect the various keyboard shortcuts that were described in the "Issues" page of the GitHub page of the MineTime project.

*Update*: with version 1.8.5 of Minetime, there have been some major updates of the keyboard shortcuts implementation, as indicated [in the announcement](https://github.com/marcoancona/MineTime/releases/tag/v1.8.5).

MineTime is not particularly keyboard-friendly, however:
- there aren't a lot of keyboard shortcuts;
- they are not documented;
- some of them "overlap", that is they execute duplicate commands, see [this issue](https://github.com/marcoancona/MineTime/issues/255#issue-772463280).

## Disclaimer

There is here *absolutely no claim to be complete*.

Also I should add that I am in no way affiliated or in any other way connected to the MineTime software and/or his developers; but I like it and their work :smiley:.

## MineTime keyboard shortcuts

You find them [in this separate file](minetime-kbd-shortcuts.md).
